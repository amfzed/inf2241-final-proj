## Framing quotes
- I want to suggest that in fixating on access and expertise, we reify a deficient understanding of how algorithms exist and work “in the wild,” outside of the theoretical definitions found in computer science textbooks (Seaver)
- However, the “what” of algorithmic inclusion is often less significant than the “how”: to include something requires decisions about how to calculate and represent it. (Seaver)
- We, humans, make urban information by various means: through sensory experience, through long-term exposure to a place, and, yes, by systematically filtering data. It’s essential to make space in our cities for those diverse methods of knowledge production. (Mattern)
- We are not concerned merely with protection from the excesses of administrative management. Instead, we want to facilitate
active engagement in the cocreation of the informational/geographic/social landscape. The question is not how to protect our privacy; it is how to be public, how to engage in public life, how to figure out one’s situation, identity, and desires in community. (Phillips)

## Framing questions
(In no particular order)

- What do you value when you travel?
- When getting from point A to point B, what factors besides time do you consider when deciding how to get there?
  - Nice scenery?
  - Avoiding street harassment?
  - Avoiding running into people? Or conversely, the chance that you might run into someone you know?
  - Seeing something new?
- How dow these factors relate to your identities or sense of self? (e.g., if you factor in street harassment, how does that relate to your gender identity?)
- If you were to assign these factors as costs, just like distance or time, how would you quantify them? How would you rank their relative importance?
- What is an optimal route? What do you optimize for? What would a route look like if we optimized for something else?
- When deciding on where to go as a group, how do you all decide on your destination and route? What values are prioritized? Who holds those values close? (e.g., does your group take an Uber, the bus, or bike? Do you detour through the park? Take streets with broader sidewalks? Avoid that one doorway with the permanently angry character?)
- Do you use an app to route you through the city? When did you start using it? How has the way you traveled through the city changed?
- What possible other experiences can someone miss out on by only ever taking the recommended route?

## Instructions
- By yourself
- With somebody else
